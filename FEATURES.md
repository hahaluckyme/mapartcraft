forked from mms0316 (a lot of features come from there)

# 1. Better Presets

# 2. Defaulted to 2D with 90% brightness
Because survival mode is more common with these tools and 3d is very difficult
Also 90% brightness because 2d is only using a [0.86x multiplier](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Map_item_format#Map_colors) (use Full-Light for 1.0x multiplier)

# 3. Added pixelization
for bigger pixels, it is easier to place on servers without Litematica

# 10. Half-Staircasing
cuts like half of the workload for doing a full-staircased map (i hate building downwards) while being about the same as the Full-Light or Full-Dark options
